This project is a personal project of the CMAA5031 course at the Guangzhou campus of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, combined with the anime "Battle of Two Cities" to create a flying game. Jinx engages in combat with enemy airships in the canyon and can adjust its position by pressing the AD button, allowing Jinx to launch a V-boxing ring. Meet all task requirements announced by TA.
